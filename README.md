This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). You will need to set up a `.env` in the root with the following variables:

```
SECRET_KEY=GOCSPX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=000000000000-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

Then run:

```bash
uv run run.py
```
